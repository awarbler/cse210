      <h1>Week 3 : Team Challenge</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Distributed version control is a form of version control in which the
        complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every
        developer's computer. This improves the ability to work offline and
        does not rely on a single location for backups.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this assignment is to practice the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Collaborate with others, using a branch-based workflow in a distributed version control system. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Write a program that spans multiple files.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Complete both parts of this assignment to create a program that is spread across multiple files, authored by
        multiple collaborators, and stored in version control.</p>

      <h3>Part I - Version Control</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div>
            Select one person to act as the team lead or the person in charge of creating remote repositories and
            responding to pull requests.

            <ul class="teamNotes">
                <li>Team Leader = Michael De Spain  </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
      
        <li>
          <div>
            Team Leader: Create a new remote repository called
            <i>cse210-tc03</i>. Initialize the repository with a README.
            md file.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            All Members: Clone the remote repository on your computer.
            <ul class="teamNotes">
              <li> how to clone 
                - get the repository html link go to link 
                - click code 
                - click https
                - copy the link address</li>
                <li>go to visual studios 
                - click view
                - click command palette
                - git clone 
                - enter clone for the github
                - save new workspace to desktop
               </li>
               <li>Or we can clone it in git<br>
                    navigate to correct directory<br>
                    ex from book: cd cse210-projects<br>
                    clone clone the repository<br>
                    ex from book: git clone https://github.com/byui-burton/my-project

                     </li>
          </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            All Members: Create a feature branch called [name]-bio. For
            example, if your first name was Matt your branch would be called
            <i>matt-bio</i>.
            <ul class="teamNotes">
              <li>ex in terminal: git branch anita-bio</li>
              <li>Check to see if it was created : <br>
                  git branch <br></li>
                  <li>Switch to new branch <br>
                    git switch anita-bio <br></li>
                    <li>Switch to new branch in visual studio <br>
                      go to source control-- more actions or click ... go to branch--- go to create branch-- type branch name<br></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            All Members: Change into the new feature branch you created. Modify
            the README.md file by adding your name and a short paragraph about
            yourself. Commit your changes and push them to the remote
            repository.
            <ul class="teamNotes">
              <li>Switch to new branch <br>
                Terminal: git switch anita-bio <br></li>
                <li>edit file-- In visual studio- command s (to save)- source control-- enter message-- click commit, push </li>
                <li>terminal: after edit  <br>
                  git switch anita-bio--edit file in visual studio--Terminal: git status--git add .--git commit -m "edit read.md 
                  file with bio" git push origin anita-bio-- git switch main<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            All Members: Open a new pull-request for the changes you made in
            your feature branch.
            <ul class="teamNotes">
              <li>Terminal: git pull</li>
            </ul>
            
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            Team Leader: Resolve each pull-request by merging each team
            member's feature branch into the main branch. Delete the feature
            branch when you are done. You may need to meet with your team
            members to make sure that you merge their feature branches
            correctly.
            <ul class="teamNotes">
              <li>delete branch Terminal :git branch -d anita-bio </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
      
          <div>
            All Members: Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository to obtain everyone's changes.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Part II - Write a program that spans multiple files</h3>
      <p>For this part, you will follow the same pattern as before, but this time, you will write a program according to
        the following specifications:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Within your repository, create a folder that will contain your Python code. Make sure to follow the
            convention to include a special file to make it a package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a new main file. Make sure to follow the naming conventions for this file, so the package can be run
            directly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Have this main file output the text, "Welcome to our collaborative program."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Commit this file and folder to version control and make sure it is merged into the main branch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure that each person can pull this file to their computers and can run the program.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Have each person on the team create their own separate Python file using their last name as the file name
            (for example, <code>young.py</code>). In that file, create a function to display a greeting that contains
            your name, such as "Hello from Brigham Young". Then, modify the main program file to include this function
            from the other file, and call it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Work through committing and merging this code into your repository one person at a time, so that the end
            result is a folder that contains a file from each person, and a main program that includes a function from
            each file and calls them each in turn.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>



      <h2>Submitting</h2>
      <p>
